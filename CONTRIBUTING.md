### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, include:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description** of the suggested enhancement
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**
- **List some examples** of how it would be used

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues labeled:

- `good first issue` ‚Äî Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` ‚Äî Extra attention needed
- `enhancement` ‚Äî New feature requests

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/zombiQWERTY/list_am_bot.git
cd list_am_bot
```

### 2. Set Up Environment

```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your development settings (BOT_TOKEN is required)
```

### 3. Start Services

```bash
make up
```

### 4. First Time Setup: Create Database Schema

```bash
# Access container
docker exec -it list_am_bot.core bash

# Create schemas
psql $POSTGRES_BASE_URL -c "CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS core;"

# Run migrations
/opt/typeorm-migrate.sh

# Exit
exit
```

### 5. Verify Setup

```bash
# Check logs
make logs

# Should see bot started successfully
```

### 6. Making Changes

When you modify code:

```bash
# If you added dependencies
npm install <package-name>
make rebuild-one
```

## üìù Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript Style

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Enable strict type checking
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use `unknown` instead of `any` when type is truly unknown
- Export types and interfaces when they're used in multiple files

### Code Structure

- Follow the **layered architecture** pattern:
  - `domain/` ‚Äî Pure business logic, no dependencies
  - `application/` ‚Äî Use cases, orchestrates domain
  - `infrastructure/` ‚Äî External implementations (DB, HTTP, etc.)
  - `interfaces/` ‚Äî Controllers, bot handlers
  - `common/` ‚Äî Shared utilities

- Keep functions **small and focused**
- Use **descriptive names** for variables and functions
- Avoid **deep nesting** (max 3 levels)

### NestJS Conventions

- Use **dependency injection** for all services
- Implement proper **module separation**
- Use **port/adapter pattern** for repositories
- Apply **exception filters** for error handling
- Use **guards** for authorization (when applicable)

### Naming Conventions

```typescript
// Classes: PascalCase
class UserService {}
class SubscriptionRepository {}

// Interfaces: PascalCase with 'I' prefix for ports
interface IUserRepository {}

// Variables/Functions: camelCase
const userName = 'John';
function getUserById() {}

// Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
const MAX_RETRIES = 3;
const LIST_AM_BOT = 'LIST_AM_BOT';

// Files: kebab-case
user.service.ts;
subscription.repository.ts;
```

### Comments

- Write **self-documenting code** ‚Äî code should be readable without comments
- Add comments only when explaining **why**, not **what**
- Remove commented-out code
- Avoid obvious comments

```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad
// Check if user exists
if (user) {
}

// ‚úÖ Good
// Legacy users don't have email field, so we skip validation
if (user && !user.email) {
}
```

### Testing

- Write **unit tests** for business logic
- Use **mocks** for external dependencies
- Aim for **80%+ code coverage**
- Test **edge cases** and error scenarios

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test

# With coverage
npm run test:cov
```

## üì§ Commit Messages

We follow **Conventional Commits** specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat` ‚Äî New feature
- `fix` ‚Äî Bug fix
- `docs` ‚Äî Documentation changes
- `style` ‚Äî Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor` ‚Äî Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- `perf` ‚Äî Performance improvements
- `test` ‚Äî Adding or updating tests
- `chore` ‚Äî Maintenance tasks (dependencies, build, etc.)

### Examples

```bash
feat(bot): add multi-language support

- Added i18n infrastructure
- Implemented English and Russian translations
- Users can switch language in settings

Closes #42
```

```bash
fix(scraper): handle timeout errors gracefully

Previously, timeout errors would crash the worker.
Now we catch and log them, then retry with backoff.

Fixes #38
```

```bash
refactor(subscription): extract validation to domain layer

Moved subscription query validation from service to entity.
No functional changes, just better separation of concerns.
```
